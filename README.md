IT IdeaTask JDBC

A Java application demonstrating JDBC database operations for managing tasks and users in an IT ideas tracking system.
Overview

This project implements a database management system for tracking IT ideas and tasks using Java JDBC with MySQL. The application provides functionality for user management, task operations, and database interactions through a console-based interface.
Features

    User Management: Create, read, update, and delete user accounts

    Task Management: Full CRUD operations for tasks including creation, assignment, and status tracking

    Database Operations: Comprehensive JDBC implementation with prepared statements

    Console Interface: User-friendly menu-driven interface for all operations

Prerequisites

    Java JDK 8 or higher

    MySQL Server

    MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver

Database Setup

    Create a MySQL database named it_idea_task

    The application will automatically create the necessary tables:

        users: Stores user information (id, username, email, password)

        tasks: Stores task details (id, title, description, status, due_date, user_id)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/Alejandroramirez07/it-ideataskjdbc.git

    Import the project into your preferred Java IDE

    Add MySQL Connector/J to your project classpath

    Update database connection details in the Java files if needed

Usage

Run the main class to start the application. The console menu provides the following options:

    User Operations

        Create new user

        View all users

        Update user information

        Delete user

    Task Operations

        Create new task

        View all tasks

        Update task information

        Delete task

        Assign task to user
